Here are the steps to set up a home lab for Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using the Elastic Web portal and a Kali Linux VM:

1. **Create a free Elastic account**: Start by creating a free Elastic account and log in to the Elastic Cloud console. Then, start a free trial, create an Elasticsearch deployment, and choose your region and deployment size ¹.

2. **Set up the Linux VM**: Download the Kali Linux VM from the official website and set up a new VM with the Kali VM file using your preferred virtualization platform (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware). Complete the Kali Linux installation and log in with both the default username and default password as kali ¹.

3. **Set up the agent to collect logs**: Install the agent on your Kali VM by following the steps provided on Elastic’s blog post. Click on “Add integrations” on the bottom left, click on “Elastic Defend” and follow the instructions to install the Elastic agent on your Kali VM in your Kali terminal. Verify that the agent successfully downloaded with the terminal command `sudo systemctl status elastic-agent.service` ¹.

4. **Generate security events on the Kali VM**: Once the agent is installed, you can generate security events on the Kali VM. This will help you to test the SIEM and ensure that it is working correctly ¹.

5. **Query and analyze the logs in the SIEM**: Finally, you can query and analyze the logs in the SIEM. You can create dashboards and establish security alerts to monitor your system ¹.

This project is a great addition to your cyber security skillset and can be a valuable talking point for job interviews. Good luck! 🍀
